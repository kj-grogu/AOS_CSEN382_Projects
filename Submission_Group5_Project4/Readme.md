# Readme file for Project Swapping and Paging Algorithms

    Requirements
    	•	Java Development Kit (JDK)
    	•	Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)
    	•	Understanding of memory management concepts
    Project Structure
    	•	Page.java: Represents a page in the simulation and provides methods for page management.
    	•	Process.java: Defines the characteristics of a process in the simulation.
    	•	FirstComeFirstServe.java: Implements the First Come First Serve page replacement algorithm.
    	•	LeastFrequentlyUsed.java: Implements the Least Frequently Used page replacement algorithm.
    	•	LeastRecentlyUsed.java: Implements the Least Recently Used page replacement algorithm.
    	•	MostFrequentlyUsed.java: Implements the Most Frequently Used page replacement algorithm.
    	•	RandomPick.java: Implements the Random Pick page replacement algorithm.
    	•	Main.java: Main class to execute the simulation.
    How to Run
    	•	Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
    	•	Ensure that the JDK is configured.
    	•	Run the Main.java file.
    Output
    	The simulation results, including average hit/miss ratios and detailed process swap-in/exit records, will be displayed in the console.
    	Adjust simulation parameters and algorithms in the respective Java files for further experimentation.
